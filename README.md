ðŸ§  ChatbotAI â€“ Java-Based Rule-Based Chatbot using Stanford CoreNLP
ChatbotAI is a simple rule-based chatbot built with Java and powered by the Stanford CoreNLP library for basic natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as tokenization and sentence splitting. This project demonstrates how to create a lightweight conversational assistant using keyword-based logic and NLP preprocessing.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
Java â€“ Core language used for development

Stanford CoreNLP (v4.5.1) â€“ For text processing (tokenization, sentence splitting)

Maven â€“ Build and dependency management

SLF4J (Simple Logging Facade for Java) â€“ Logging framework (slf4j-simple)

ðŸ’¡ Features
Basic NLP preprocessing using CoreNLP (tokenize, ssplit)

Rule-based keyword matching to respond to user inputs

Console-based interaction using Scanner

Simple and clean architecture for beginner-level chatbot development

ðŸ“¦ How It Works
User input is taken via the command line.

CoreNLP is used to tokenize and split the input into sentences.

The chatbot processes the input with basic keyword checks (e.g., "hello", "bye", "weather").

A predefined response is returned based on the matched keyword.

ðŸ“Œ Limitations
No machine learning or AI-based intent detection

Static responses with no memory or dialogue context

Limited to basic interactions and keyword matching
