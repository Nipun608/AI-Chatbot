ChatbotAI is a lightweight, rule-based chatbot developed in Java and powered by Stanford CoreNLP for simple natural language processing tasks such as tokenization and sentence splitting. It's a beginner-friendly project that demonstrates the fundamentals of building a console-based conversational assistant.

🔧 Technologies Used
Tool	Description
💻 Java	Core programming language
🧠 Stanford CoreNLP (v4.5.1)	Tokenization & sentence splitting
📦 Maven	Project build and dependency management
🪵 SLF4J (Simple Logging Facade for Java)	Logging (slf4j-simple)

💡 Features
🧠 Basic NLP with CoreNLP annotators: tokenize, ssplit

🧾 Rule-based keyword detection (e.g., hello, bye, weather)

💬 Interactive console-based chatbot using Scanner

🧱 Simple, modular structure ideal for learning or extension

📦 How It Works
text
Copy
Edit
1. User inputs a message via the console.
2. Stanford CoreNLP processes the text using basic annotators.
3. The chatbot scans for known keywords (like "hello" or "weather").
4. A relevant hardcoded response is returned.
⚠️ Limitations
❌ No machine learning or AI-based intent detection

🧠 Lacks memory or contextual conversation handling

⛔ Only responds to static keyword-based inputs

🎯 Ideal for students, beginners in NLP, or developers exploring chatbot development without deep AI.
